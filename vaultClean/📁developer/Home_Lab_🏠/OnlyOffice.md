> Run your private office with the ONLYOFFICE

I needed a simple doc, spreadsheet, and slides. I've tried [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
but wasn't satisfied. **OnlyOffice** has some great features and compatibility right out of the box. Also it's one of the sexiest lookinzg free office suits.

### connections
- I keep all docs in my [Nextcloud](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Nextcloud.md) instance to have them always accessible and synced between devices
- might later look into hosting a server and hook into [Nextcloud](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Nextcloud.md) for cloud side editing.
