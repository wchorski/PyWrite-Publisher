when I need to make a **One to One** copy of a directory, internally or to another machine via a [SAMBA](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/SAMBA.md) share. I originally used this exclusively until I found [Duplicati](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Duplicati.md)

## setup
- run the sync script manually once you point directories
- you can either fire off the sync script via a **Windows Schedule** or **Bash Script** 
- use their [RealTimeSync](https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=realtimesync) version if you need something that **watches** a directory
