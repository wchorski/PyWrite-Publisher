much respect for the people who have the time and patience to learn vim. I do not have either of those, yet I still find myself thrown into a vim editor on accident every once in a while. You'll know you're in vim when you see a line of `~` flow down the left side

```shell
~
~
~
~
(END)
```

### How to exit vim editor in terminal
