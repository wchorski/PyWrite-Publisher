> [!quote] The concept of the Dunning-Kruger effect is based on a [1999 paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e320/9ca64cbed9a441e55568797cbd3683cf7f8c.pdf) by Cornell University psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger. The pair tested participants on their logic, grammar, and [sense of humor](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/humor "Psychology Today looks at sense of humor"), and found that those who performed in the bottom quartile rated their skills far above average. For example, those in the 12th percentile self-rated their expertise to be, on average, in the 62nd percentile.

### Why do people fail to recognize their own incompetence?
Many people would describe themselves as above average in intelligence, humor, and a variety of skills. They can’t accurately judge their own competence, because they lack _metacognition,_ or the ability to step back and [examine oneself objectively](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/supersurvivors/201806/why-the-least-competent-people-often-think-theyre-the-best). In fact, those who are the least skilled are also the most likely to overestimate their abilities.

### What is the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger effect?
If the Dunning-Kruger effect is being overconfident in one’s knowledge or performance, its polar opposite is _[Imposter Syndrome](🚿%20shower%20thoughts/Psycology/Imposter%20Syndrome.md)
