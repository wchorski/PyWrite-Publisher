### basic interface config
**Speed and duplex**
- 10 / 100 / 1000 / 10gig
- duplex: half/full
- automatic & manual
> [!warning] ^ needs to match on both sides

- IP addr managment
	- Layer 3 interface 
	- VLAN interface
	- IP addr, subnet mask / CIDR block, default gateway, DNS(optional)

### LAG and Mirroring
- port bonding / link aggregation
	- multi interface acts like one big interface
	- **LACP** ( Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
- link switches with multiple ethernet lines, acts as one large line

### port mirroring
- copy traffic from interfaces
- example - PC sends to switch, switch copies to local server and sends out to public

### Jumbo Frames
- increase frame 1,500 -> 9,216 bytes
- better efficiency 
> [!warning] all ethernet devices in route must support Jumbo Frames

### Ethernet flow control
- you'll never know how fast or slow traffic will flow
- if things get busy, tell other device to slow down
- flow control method **IEEE 802.3x** - "pause" frame

### Port security
- prevent some random plugging a device into a physical switch
- based on source MAC addr
- per port config basis
- config max of source MAC addr
- monitors number of unique MAC
- Switch alerts admin if any criteria is excedid
