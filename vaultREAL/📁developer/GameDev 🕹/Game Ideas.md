## Peer Pressure

going of the static script of [Dark Room White Tunnel](%F0%9F%93%81developer/GameDev%20%F0%9F%95%B9/Dark%20Room%20White%20Tunnel.md). use [Twine](https://twinery.org/) to construct the branching storylines and mechanics of the game

start off as 1 of 4 player
First branch is declining the drug. leave un scathedÂ 

If you take the drug you are then propelled into a series of quick time events

If you mess up you black out

The scene starts again with the door opening but now you're a different character. You are presented the same choices with subtle changes in quick time events that throw off the player.

After 2 failed attempts the game clock speed gets faster.

after multiple failed attempts the game loop becomes so fast it's unplayable. Hopefully causing the player to mash or hold buttons to quit the game.

Quick time events

Your character comes incredibly small and you try not to get stepped on by others

### ENDINGS
1. intended loss of psyche and end up in Utopia (turns into a FPS)
2. fall into personal scary hell
3. Make one really good linear story and branch from there.
4. Make 2 NPCs have a love interested that you can break or make
5. Give each character a love language

perfect to write in a JS framework
