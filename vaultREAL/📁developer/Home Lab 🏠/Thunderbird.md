## [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)
> Make Email Easier. Thunderbird is a free email application that’s easy to set up and customize - and it’s loaded with great features! 

I grew tired of juggling between #Outlook, 2 #Gmail accounts, plus my [Nextcloud](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Nextcloud.md) calendars. Normally accessing them through their native web apps. Plus I wanted a seamless way to drop in templates, create filters across inboxes. Plus I'm trying to go all #FOSS

## sync profiles between devices
I can sync plugins, templates, filters, etc. between devices with these steps

1. copy your current profile. start in Thunderbird top right ` hamberger menu > Help > More Troubleshooting info >  Profile Folder > Open Folder Button`
2. copy contents into your sync solution. (I use [Nextcloud](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Nextcloud.md))
3. rename folder to desired profile name
4. dig into the Thunderbird menu again ` hamberger menu > Help > More Troubleshooting info >  Profiles > about:profiles`
5. click that `about:profiles` link and set up a new profile.
6. point to the newly copied / renamed folder
