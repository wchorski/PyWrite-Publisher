I've dabbled in blogging / tutorial making, but was always bogged down with the speed of [Wordpress](Home%20Lab%20🏠/Wordpress.md). with **Obsidian** I get the speed of a local text editor, the extensibility of an [IDE](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29057.the-small-basic-environment-ide.aspx), and simplicity that [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) offers. Plus I can use it for client tracking, self improvement, and idea generation. I'd recommend anybody that knows more than 5 keyboard shortcuts to ditch whatever blogging tool they currently use [In Flavor](📁shower_thoughts/In%20Flavor.md) of **Obsidian**
