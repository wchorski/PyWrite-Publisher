> a note taking app for people who are obsessed with Markdown 


I've dabbled in blogging / tutorial making, but was always bogged down with the speed of [Wordpress](%F0%9F%93%81developer/Home%20Lab%20%F0%9F%8F%A0/Wordpress.md). with **Obsidian** I get 

- the speed of a local text editor, 
- extensibility of an [IDE](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29057.the-small-basic-environment-ide.aspx),  
- simplicity that [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) offers. 

Plus I can use it for client tracking, tutorial making, and idea generation. I'd recommend anybody that knows more than 5 keyboard shortcuts to ditch whatever blogging tool they currently use [In Flavor](%F0%9F%93%81shower_thoughts/In%20Flavor.md) of **Obsidian**
