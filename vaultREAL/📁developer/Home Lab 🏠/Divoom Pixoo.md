## notifications
- 🔋 phone battery is charging
- 🔋 phone battery is full
- ✉ I got physical mail delivered (via IMAP)
- 🌵 water my plants (set on timer, but in the future I want a moisture sensor in the plants)
- ⏰ shows me the time when I start my **wake up** automation
- 😴 60 second [Kirby™](https://kirby.nintendo.com/) nightlight when I start my **pre sleep** automation
- 🚪 greets me when I arrive home
- 🚪 says goodbye when I leave home
- 🧺 Show me when the laundry cycle is complete (currently just a timed event, but later would like to connect with a light sensor on the "cycle complete" LED)

## create custom graphics
I also took the time to make some 16x16 pixel gifs to coincide with each notification. I use [Piskel - Free online sprite editor](https://www.piskelapp.com/) because there is an **Offline Version** incase I want to make tweaks or copies of my animations.
