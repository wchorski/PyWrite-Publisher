## tips & tricks

converting markdown to HTML like in my [Obsidian Publish with NextJS](%F0%9F%93%81developer/Projects%F0%9F%93%90/Obsidian%20Publish%20with%20NextJS.md) project doesn't respect single line breaks unless you give it 2 spaces at the end of the line
```
Use two or more spaces   <-- 2 or more spaces
to create a line break.
```
