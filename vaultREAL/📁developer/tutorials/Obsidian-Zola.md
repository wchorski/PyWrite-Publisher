a much easier way to publish Obsidian Vaults (although [Quartz-w_Boswell](%F0%9F%93%81developer/tutorials/Quartz-w_Boswell.md) has some percs, this was much faster to publish and, out of the box, it looks nicer)

### setup
1. start a git repo for your **Obsidian Vault**. i.e. [wchorski/obsidian-dnd: obsidian note network for Dungeon & Dragons (github.com)](github.com))
	1. Use `.gitignore` to prevent folders / files from being added to your public garden
2. create a `netlify.toml` inside root of your vault. Copy past from `netlify.example.toml`
	1. [obsidian-zola/netlify.example.toml at main Â· ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola (github.com)](github.com))
	2. fork the repo and change  top `command = ` endpoint (if you'd like to change anything in the design)
3. create [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) site that links with git repo of your **Obsidian Vault** 
4. push **Obsidian Vault** to git and watch it auto build
